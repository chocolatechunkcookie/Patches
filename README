Summary
-------
Patches aims to be a fully-customizable IDE for developers who prefer 
working with text editors such as Vim or emacs, but would like to have 
all of their development tools consolidated into one application for 
ease of use. Patches does not offer much above and beyond the standard 
capabilities of the applications it encapsulates, but rather offers a 
convenience by grouping them all together.

Core Features
-------------
- Consolidation of command prompt, text editor, compiler, and any 
  other (compatible) development tools into one application
- Customizeable shortcut keys/toolbar buttons for common development 
  tasks
- Maximize workspace elements
- Minimize workspace elements
- Restore workspace elements

Wishlist Features

- Drag-and-drop widget creation; drag a window running on the desktop 
  into Patches and automatically convert that application into a 
  Patches widget
- Drag-and-drop widget expansion; drag a widget from Patches onto the 
  desktop and automatically convert it to a Windows process
